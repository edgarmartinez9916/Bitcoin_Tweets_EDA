Data: 5/14/2022

This is an Exploratory Data Analysis project on the [Kaggle Trending Bitcoin Tweets Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaushiksuresh147/bitcoin-tweets). This Dataset cointains over 3 million tweets and 12 columns from Feburary 2021 to April of 2022. The purpose of this project was to conduct and Exploratory Data Analysis to become familar with the data. This was done by cleaning and processing the csv file from Kaggle to conducting the EDA in a Jupyter Notebook. Potential next steps for this project includes conducting a sentiment analysis of tweets, conducting a correlation analysis with tweet data and actual price of bitcoin, and conducting an in-depth EDA on all variables.
